I have not updated the blog in a while, so I'm going to go over what I've done in the last few months.

### what I'm working on
At work I am currently on a data analysis apprenticeship.
This is provided by a company called Whitehat and it is made up of a level 4 qualification from the British Charted Institute for IT (BCS) and the Dell EMC certificate in Data Science and Big Data Analytics.
So far this has been giving more a more solid foundation in data analytics concepts and I've started incorporating some of the techniques into my day job.

### Project updates
for my groceries analysis project I have created a dashboard since my last update.. I will be updating the [project page][1] with more details of what I have done.

The dashboard uses the Dash python library to create a plots and some interactive elements such as dropdowns and radio buttons. Currently I'm able to see a time series plot of the total for each order. I can also see the proportion of the order which was delivered as ordered, substituted or simply unavailable. 
The dashboard also has a second page that allows me to select a specific order in a dropdown and see a table of all the items on that order. I have plans to add an third page which has more information on how much I am spending on certain items. Before creating this I want to categorise items into broader categories so that I can look at trends more easily. My idea for this is to create a script which pulls the list of items then asks me to input a few different categories.

This dashboard is deployed using the [Heroku service][2] and the data itself is stored in a Heroku Postgres server instance. I am using the free version of Heroku which is all I need since it is only myself and my partner who will be using this dashboard.

### What I'm learning
For reading outside of my course, I am trying to get to grips with the basics of using the R programming language.

The resource I'm currently using is the *R for Data Science* book by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund. The book is available for free online [here][3].
I have found this book to be very well written, with plently of examples and exercises.
It teaches the general ideas of visualisation, wrangling and R programming. Everything is taught through the *tidyverse* packages, for example visualisation with *ggplot2*, and transformations with *dplyr*.

Finally I have been following some of the courses on Kaggle. These focus on the basics of machine learning. So far I've completed the intro to machine learning course and I'm currently following the intermediate machine learning course.
