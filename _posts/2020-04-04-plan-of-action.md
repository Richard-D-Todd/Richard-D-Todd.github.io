# What courses am i currently taking?

I am currently following the ['IBM Data Science Professional Certificate' on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science?). This is a collection of 9 courses of which I have completed 4 and I am currently on the 5th course 'Databases and SQL for Data Science':
1. __What is Data Science?__
2. __Open Source tools for Data Science__
3. __Data Science Methodology__
4. __Python for Data Science and AI__
5. __Databases and SQL for Data Science__
6. _Data Analysis with Python_
7. _Data Visualisation with Python_
8. _Machine Learning with Python_
9. _Applied Data Science Capstone_

So far the courses have been of varying quality. I like the fact that all the courses start from basics and have hands on labs. What I dislike is the emphasis on using IBMs Watson ecosystem of tools and the fact that some of the guides on how to use these tools are outdated.

For my work I have also wanted to learn more about Excel Macros VBA and so I have started a course on Udemy. This course is called ['Unlock Excel VBA and Excel Macros'](https://www.udemy.com/course/excel-vba-and-macros-course/). 

I have heard mixed things about the quality of Udemy courses so we shall see how this course goes, however I only want to know how to automate a few tasks, therefore I don't need too much depth.
