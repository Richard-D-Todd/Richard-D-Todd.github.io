## What courses am i currently taking?

I am currently following the ['IBM Data Science Professional Certificate' on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science?). This is a collection of 9 courses of which I have completed 4 and I am currently on the 5th course 'Databases and SQL for Data Science':
1. __What is Data Science?__
2. __Open Source tools for Data Science__
3. __Data Science Methodology__
4. __Python for Data Science and AI__
5. __Databases and SQL for Data Science__
6. _Data Analysis with Python_
7. _Data Visualisation with Python_
8. _Machine Learning with Python_
9. _Applied Data Science Capstone_

So far the courses have been of varying quality. I like the fact that all the courses start from basics and have hands on labs. What I dislike is the emphasis on using IBMs Watson ecosystem of tools and the fact that some of the guides on how to use these tools are outdated.

For my work I have also wanted to learn more about Excel Macros VBA and so I have started a course on Udemy. This course is called ['Unlock Excel VBA and Excel Macros'](https://www.udemy.com/course/excel-vba-and-macros-course/). 

I have heard mixed things about the quality of Udemy courses so we shall see how this course goes, however I only want to know how to automate a few tasks, therefore I don't need too much depth.

## Plan of action!
I have recently started watching a few videos on the Youtube channel 'Python Prgrammer'. He has several great videos that list resources he recommends to learn more about data science and python, particularly for a beginner.

The first video I will mention is his video _'How to Become a Data Scientist'_. He outlines 5 essential things to cover:
1. __Learn Python__
2. __Learn Maths__
  * __Linear Algebra__
  * __Calculus__
  * __Statistics__
3. __Learn Python Libraries__
  * __Numpy__
  * __Scipy__
  * __Pandas__
  * __Matplotlib__
  * __Seaborn__
  * __Scikit Learn__
4. __Practice! Recommends Kaggle__
5. __Github__
  * __Upload projects to Github__
  * __From Kaggle projects__
  * __Can get good quality, large datasets from the US and UK goverment data for own projects__

The description of his video provides links to all the resources mention in his video. But I will also link them below for my own reference.

### Python 
I am already learning Python, through the IBM Data Science course on Coursera and using the book 'Python for Data Analysis' by Wes McKinney. 


### Maths 
I am already familiar with the three topics mentioned in the video above. However I am sure that I will require a refresher and to learn it form another perspective. Giles in the video above mentions Kahn Academy, the MIT Calculus videos on Youtube and 3Blue1Brown. I have also recently read an article entitled [_'4 free maths courses to do in quarantine and level up your Data Science skills'_](https://towardsdatascience.com/4-free-maths-courses-to-do-in-quarantine-and-level-up-your-data-science-skills-f815daca56f7). The author mentions four courses:

1. [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning) on Coursera
2. [Essential Math for Machine Learning: Python Edition](https://www.edx.org/course/essential-math-for-machine-learning-python-editi-2) on EdX
3. [Probability and Statistics in Data Science using Python](https://www.edx.org/course/probability-and-statistics-in-data-science-using-p) on EdX
4. [Bayesian Statistics: From Concept to Data Analysis](https://www.coursera.org/learn/bayesian-statistics) on Coursera

## Python Libraries
Most of these libraries are taught on various 'Python for Data Science' courses and in book on Python.

## Practice
I must admit I have not really practiced what I have learn so far. I will make sure to sign up for Kaggle and give some of the projects a go. I will also start sharing the Notebooks created during the courses I follow.

## Github
I have signed up for Github and I'm currently undertaking my first project of parsing my groceries receipt email in Python and saving the contents as a table in a .csv file.

In this video he explains a 'hierarchy of platforms' with: 
>Udemy &lt; DataCamp/DataQuest &lt; Edx/Coursera

## Even more resources
The final video I will share list a large variety of resources to develop coding and data analysis/science skills:
