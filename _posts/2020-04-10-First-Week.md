My first week after creating this blog is now completed. So what have I done?

This week I have focused on Python. From two sources:
1. [Quantitative Economics with Python](https://python.quantecon.org/)   
I covered the topics:
  - Python Essentials
  - OOP I: Introduction to Object Oriented Programming
  - OOP II: Building Classes

2. [Python Data Science Handbook](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook/blob/8a34a4f653bdbdc01415a94dc20d4e9b97438965/notebooks/Index.ipynb)
  - I read the first chapter _'IPython: Beyond Normal Python'_ and started the second chapter _'Introduction to NumPy'_.

The quant econ course is very good. It has a range of exercises which actually made me think unlike with some places which give very easy examples. I also liked that it did not shy away from using maths equations in the examples.

The first chapter of the Python Data Science Handbook was very useful in introducing the IPython shell and showing some tips and tricks for IPython.Jupyter notebooks.

### Plan for the week ahead
I will continue with learning Python and NumPy basics with the Quant Econ course and the Python Data Science handbook. I also plan to completed the IBM Coursera course _'Databases and SQL for Data Science'_.

At work I am wanting to use VBA to clean up some report extracts I have created and add them to the data model of a new workbook, where I can then analysis the results. For this I will search as I go and maybe start the VBA and Macro course I have bought on Udemy.

### Retrospection
The week I have realised that I can practice using Python and its scientific libraries by plotting mathematical equations I am familiar with from my Chemistry degree. Additionally I would like to learn how to use Python to access data in a PostgreSQL database.
