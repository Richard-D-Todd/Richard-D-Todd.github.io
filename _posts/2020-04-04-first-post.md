 So this is my first post!

## What is the goal of this site? ##
This site is intended to be a space for me to document what I have been learning on a weekly basis. It can be anything I have learnt during my week, however my focus at the minute is on data analysis and learning to code.


## My background ##
My academic background is in Chemistry. After many years including ups and downs I graduated with a 2:1 in Chemistry. What I found however is that the area of Chemistry that insterested me would require a Master's to really have a chance to get a job in that field. After my time studying I wa hesitant to follow the Master's route, both for financial reasons, and also for the personal reason that I had been a student for far too long and I wanted something different. 

I eventually found a job on a Service Centre. I never really considered IT while studying at university, but while I have been at this job I have slowly made myself a niche in the team. I have involved myself with ITSM account administration and training. The former as I am suited to the attentiion of detail required and the later as I have always enjoyed teaching others. During this time I have been developing my Excel skills on various projects, teaching myself how to use Power Query to link to Access DB queries, adding these to the data model and then using Pivot Tables for analysis of this data. I have also taught myself the basics of using macros and VBA scripting, and this will be some of the things I will be learning during this blogging process.

## So why learn data anlysis and coding? ##
What the above has made me realise is that I still want to learn no matter my surroundings, even when not in a formal education setting.

I have had an interest in learning to code in the past, but have never properly persued it. Now I am starting to realise the strengths to knowing how to write code. The flexibility it gives is enourmous, especially with the huge variety of open source tools. It allows for problems to be solved by breaking them into smaller pieces and then building up from their, writing code to suite your requirements. 

The interest in data I guess has always been there. I have a brain that likes to characterise and calculate. I have always had an interest in how the world works, even when young and this is what lead to be studying a STEM subject at degree level. While I may not be persuing scientific research, I still have that mindset ingrained and I can see myself taking to using data analysis to investigate hwo things work and gain insights into data.

My first proper use of data analysis would be during my Chemistry degree. While many people see Chemistry as purely tracking the chemical transformations to get from A to B as it were, it is actually a sub disipline of the physical sciences and had a rigorous basis in mathematics alongside analysis of empirical data to say whether reality fits with the mathematical model we have computed. This has given me an insight on how to handle data. 

So basically I want to combine this wish to learn coding and my interest in data and see where it takes me! And this site is my place to document this journey.
