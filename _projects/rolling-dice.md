## Dice Rolling
[Project repo on Github][1]

### Context:
I regularly play the popular roleplaying game Dungeons and Dragons with a group of friends. This game is focused around the rolling of various dice to determine player outcomes, in particular 20 sided dice. This got me curious as to how I could calculate the probabilities of outcomes for rolling multiple dice, and rolling dice of various dimensions.

### Aims:
* Plot the probabilities of various dice rolls in Matplotlib.
* Write a script that can take an input of any combination of dice to roll and simulate mutiple dice rolls to output a probability for each outcome possible.

### Gallery

## Software and tools used:
* Python to similate dice rolls and plot probabilities of various outcomes.

### Status
Work in Progress
