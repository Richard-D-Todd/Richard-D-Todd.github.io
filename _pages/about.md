## Hi there I'm Rich.

This blog is my own slice of the internet in which to write about anything on my mind. This focus however is to track my learning on coding and data analysis. As well as being on a Data Anlysis apprenticeship through my workplace, I am also learning outside of this course in my own time. This is through a combination of books, MOOC courses, online tutorials and personal projects.

I have always been interested in explainations on how the world works. Whether this is through social sciences and economics investigating our human environment, phyical sciences explaining how things work at unimaginable scales, biological sciences investingating the complexity of life or businesses trying to understand all their complex interactions, it all requires a deep understanding of data. 

This curiosity lead me to study for a Chemistry degree. It is such an interesting and important subject as so much of the material world around us and our understanding of matter depends on sound chemical knowledge. Upon graduating I was unsure what I wanted to do next and so I found work as a Service Centre Analyst at the Smart DCC. this is the company responsible for the data infrastructure behind the UK's current smart meter roll out. It is one of the largest and most ambitious IT programs in the UK. 

I have an interest in using data analysis skills more in my day to day role and develop my skills. To this end I started an apprenticeship in Data Analytics this summer. In preparation of this course I started this blog and started learning in my free time. To practice some of my new coding skills I also started working on some personal projects that can be found in the projects section of this site.

How this website is to be used in future is pretty open, but I plan to mainly use it for writing about the skills and techinques I am learning, both on my day job, the apprenticeship and also outside of work. I may also leave the occasional book review or discussion on something I have interesting recently.
