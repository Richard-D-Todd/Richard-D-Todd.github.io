## Hi there I'm Rich.

This blog is my own slice of the internet to write about anything on my mind. The focus however is to track my learning on coding and data analysis. As well as being on a Data Anlysis apprenticeship through my workplace, I am also learning outside of this course in my own time. This is through a combination of books, MOOC courses, online tutorials and personal projects.

How this website is to be used in future is pretty open, but I plan to mainly use it for writing about the skills and techinques I am learning, both on my day job, the apprenticeship and also outside of work. I may also leave the occasional book review or discussion on something I have found interesting recently.
